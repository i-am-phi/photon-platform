- the _givens_ for the system

===

# My consciousness has become intermingled with computing

# Change is ever present
- we live in a frothy sea of change


# Everything is hierarchical
- collections of collections
- sets of sets
- iteration and recursion are your friends

# Files are the primary commodity
- all information and instructions are in files
- all files on the system can be known
- they should have a reason to be there

# We operate in contexts
- only certain information and operations can exist in certain contexts

# Clouds are nebulous 
## Build your house on a rock
