- the _givens_ for the system

===

# My consciousness has become intermingled with computing
- 35 years at a screen - for work and relaxation

# Change is ever present
- we live in a frothy sea of change

# Files are the primary commodity
- all information and instructions are in files
- all files on the system can be known
- they should have a reason to be there

# We operate in contexts
- only certain information and operations can exist in certain contexts
- this creates focus

# Clouds are nebulous 
## Build your house on a rock
