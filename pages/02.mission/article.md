Provide an integrated suite of tools for the development, publishing and management of complex content

Extensible Knowledge Base

===

> I want my ideas to come to fruition as easily as breathing

- comprehensive platform
- full stack - from OS to all the tools necessary

> I would like to be at a point where I no longer think about the tools themselves, only the way that I play them.

- not trying to be everything for everyone
- based around my own requirements
- always seeking to be performant around fundamentals
- clear set of specs for a fixed set of platforms
